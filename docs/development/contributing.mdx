## Code Contributions

### Development Workflow

#### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ASL-Methods-Generator.git
cd ASL-Methods-Generator

# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo/ASL-Methods-Generator.git
```

#### 2. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-description
```

#### 3. Make Your Changes
- Follow the coding standards outlined below
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits small and focused

#### 4. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Run all tests
docker-compose up --build
# Or run tests individually
cd apps/backend && python -m pytest
cd apps/frontend && yarn test
cd package && python -m pytest
```

#### 5. Submit a Pull Request
- Push your branch to your fork
- Create a pull request with a clear description
- Reference any related issues
- Request reviews from maintainers

### Coding Standards

#### Python (Backend & Package)
- **Style Guide**: Follow PEP 8
- **Formatting**: Use Black for code formatting
- **Import Sorting**: Use isort for import organization
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all functions
- **Documentation**: Use Google-style docstrings

```python
def process_asl_data(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process ASL data and generate validation report.
    
    Args:
        data: Dictionary containing ASL data and file paths
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing processing results and reports
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If required data is missing
        ProcessingError: If data processing fails
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

#### TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend)
- **Style Guide**: Follow ESLint configuration
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript for all new code
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Naming**: Use camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components

```typescript
interface ASLData {
  modality: string;
  files: File[];
  niftiFile: File;
}

const ASLProcessor: React.FC<{ data: ASLData }> = ({ data }) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

#### General Guidelines
- **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commit format
  ```
  feat: add new ASL validation rule
  fix: resolve file upload issue
  docs: update API documentation
  test: add unit tests for validator
  ```
- **File Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent names
- **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages
- **Logging**: Use appropriate log levels and messages

### Testing Guidelines

#### Backend Tests
```python
# tests/test_asl_processor.py
import pytest
from pyaslreport.modalities.asl.processor import ASLProcessor

class TestASLProcessor:
    def test_valid_asl_data(self):
        """Test processing of valid ASL data."""
        data = {
            "modality": "asl",
            "files": ["test_asl.json"],
            "nifti_file": "test_asl.nii.gz"
        }
        processor = ASLProcessor(data)
        result = processor.process()
        
        assert result is not None
        assert "report" in result
        assert "parameters" in result
```

#### Frontend Tests
```typescript
// __tests__/components/UploadButton.test.tsx
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import UploadButton from '../UploadButton';

describe('UploadButton', () => {
  it('should handle file upload correctly', () => {
    const mockOnUpload = jest.fn();
    const { getByLabelText } = render(
      <UploadButton onUpload={mockOnUpload} />
    );
    
    const file = new File(['test'], 'test.json', { type: 'application/json' });
    const input = getByLabelText(/upload/i);
    
    fireEvent.change(input, { target: { files: [file] } });
    
    expect(mockOnUpload).toHaveBeenCalledWith([file]);
  });
});
```
