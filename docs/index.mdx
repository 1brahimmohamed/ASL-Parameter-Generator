description: Welcome to ASL Methods Section Generator
---

The ASL Methods Section Generator Project is a tool designed to assist authors in creating the methods section of their academic papers. 
It streamlines the process by providing a structured format and prompts to ensure that all necessary information is included in 
the methods section. This tool is particularly useful for researchers who may struggle with organizing their methods or ensuring that they meet the standards of their field.


## Features
- **Structured Format**: The generator provides a clear structure for the methods section, making it easier to organize your thoughts and information.
- **Error Checking**: The tool checks for common errors and omissions, helping to ensure that your methods section is complete and accurate.
- **Convert DICOM to ASL BDIS**: The generator can convert DICOM files to ASL BDIS format, making it easier to include imaging data in your methods section.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The tool is designed to be easy to use, with a simple interface that guides you through the process of creating your methods section.
- **Add Missing Parameters**: The generator can identify and let you add missing parameters to your methods section, ensuring that all necessary information is included.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key components:
- ** Python Package**: This is the core package that contains the functionality for generating the methods section, checking for errors, and converting DICOM files.
- ** Frontend**: The frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the generator, allowing users to input their data and receive the generated methods section.
- ** Backend**: The backend handles the API calls and processes the data from the frontend and consumes the Python package to generate the methods section.
