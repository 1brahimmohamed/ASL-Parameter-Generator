description: A guide to using the ASL Methods Section Generator Python package
---

This package allows you to generate an ASL parameter report to be copied into the Methods section of paper.
It validate the ASL datasets by checking for inconsistencies, invalid values, and providing warnings for
slight variations.

<Info>Please ensure that your dataset is organized according to the BIDS standard before uploading.</Info>


## Steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Upload">
        Click the "Choose Folder" button and select the BIDS folder containing your ASL data.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Let the app handle the rest">
        The application will process your files (including xxx_asl.json and xxx_asl.nii or xxx_asl.nii.gz) and display the results below.
    </Step>
</Steps>


Note: The following specific checks and summaries will be reported:

- **Inconsistency Check**: Discrepancies between values across different sessions, such as variations in PLD, labeling duration, echo time, and voxel sizes.

- **Invalid Values Check**: Identifying values that do not meet predefined criteria, such as incorrect numeric ranges, boolean values, and string values.

- **Slight Variation Warning**: Highlighting values that might not constitute a major error but are worth noting.

- **Generated Report**: The software generates an ASL parameter report to be included in the Methods section of paper. A suggested statement for inclusion in the cover letter explaining that the relevant part of the Methods section has been constructed according to standard format is also provided (TODO).
