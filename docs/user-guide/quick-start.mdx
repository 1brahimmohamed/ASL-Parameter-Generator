description: Learn how to use the ASL Methods Section Generator App in minutes
---

This guide will walk you through using the ASL Methods Section Generator to create standardized methods sections for your ASL research papers.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll know how to:
- Upload ASL data (BIDS or DICOM format)
- Generate comprehensive validation reports
- Create standardized methods sections
- Export results as PDF reports

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **ASL Data**: Either in BIDS format or DICOM files
- **Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
- **Internet Connection**: For accessing the web application

## Step-by-Step Guide
<Steps>
    <Step title="Prepare Your Data">

#### Option A: BIDS Format (Recommended)
Ensure your data follows the BIDS standard:
```
your_dataset/
├── sub-01/
│   ├── ses-01/
│   │   ├── perf/
│   │   │   ├── sub-01_ses-01_asl.json    # ASL parameters
│   │   │   ├── sub-01_ses-01_asl.nii.gz  # ASL image data
│   │   │   ├── sub-01_ses-01_m0scan.json # M0 parameters (optional)
│   │   │   ├── sub-01_ses-01_m0scan.nii.gz # M0 image data (optional)
│   │   │   └── sub-01_ses-01_asl.tsv     # Volume timing info
│   │   └── anat/
│   │       └── sub-01_ses-01_T1w.nii.gz  # Anatomical reference
└── dataset_description.json
```


#### Option B: DICOM Files
If you have DICOM files:
- Organize them in a folder
- The application will automatically convert them to BIDS format

<Info>Please ensure that your DICOM series has more than 3 instances for the conversion.</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Upload Your Data">

1. **Choose Upload Method**:
   - Click "Choose Folder" for BIDS data
   - Or drag and drop files directly

2. **Select Data Type**:
   - Choose "BDIS" for BIDS format
   - Choose "DICOM" for DICOM files

3. **Select Modality**:
   - Currently supports "ASL" (Arterial Spin Labeling)
   - More modalities coming soon

4. **Upload Files**:
   - Select your data folder or files
   - Wait for the upload to complete
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Results">

After processing, you'll see several sections:

#### Basic Report
- **Parameter Summary**: Key ASL parameters extracted from your data
- **Validation Status**: Overall validation results
- **File Information**: Details about processed files

#### Errors & Warnings
- **Major Errors**: Critical issues that need attention
- **Minor Errors**: Issues that should be reviewed
- **Warnings**: Potential problems or inconsistencies

#### Extended Report
- **Detailed Analysis**: Comprehensive parameter breakdown
- **Consistency Checks**: Cross-validation of parameters
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for improvement
</Step>

<Step title="Generate Methods Section">

1. **Review Validation Results**:
   - Address any major errors first
   - Review warnings and minor errors
   - Ensure all required parameters are present

2. **Add Missing Parameters** (if needed):
   - Click on missing parameters to add values
   - Provide additional information when prompted

3. **Generate Report**:
   - Click "Generate Report" to create the final output
   - Review the generated methods section

</Step>

<Step title="Export Results">

1. **Download PDF Report**:
   - Click "Download PDF" to save the report
   - The PDF includes all validation results and the methods section

2. **Copy Methods Section**:
   - Copy the generated methods text
   - Paste it into your research paper

</Step>
</Steps>
## Understanding the Output

### Validation Categories

####  Valid Parameters
- Parameters that meet all validation criteria
- No action required

#### Warnings
- Parameters that may need attention
- Review for potential issues
- Examples: slight variations in timing parameters

#### Minor Errors
- Parameters that don't meet validation criteria
- Should be reviewed and corrected
- Examples: missing optional parameters

#### Major Errors
- Critical issues that must be addressed
- May indicate data quality problems
- Examples: missing required parameters, invalid values

### Report Sections

#### Basic Report
```
ASL was acquired on a 3T Siemens TrioTim scanner using multi-PLD FAIR PASL labeling and a 3D GRASE readout with the following parameters: TE = 11.92ms, 
TR = 3500ms, flip angle 180 degrees, in-plane resolution 8x4mm^2, 18 slices with 6mm thickness, inversion time 300ms (1 repeat), 600ms (1 repeat), 900ms (1 repeat), 
1200ms (1 repeat), 1500ms (1 repeat), 1800ms (1 repeat), 2100ms (1 repeat), 2400ms (1 repeat), 2700ms (1 repeat), 3000ms (1 repeat), labeling slab thickness 115.5mm, 
with bolus saturation using Q2TIPS pulse applied from 700ms to 1600ms after the labeling, with background suppression with 2 pulses at 150ms and 200ms after the start 
of labeling. In total, 10 label-control pairs were acquired. There is inconsistency in EchoTime between M0 and ASL scans. TR for M0 is 6000ms.
